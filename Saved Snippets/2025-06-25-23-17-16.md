# Lame Usernames To Use Good OPSEC

Okay, here's a list of "lame, dorky, usual" usernames that often get used by "normal people," often because they're straightforward, uncreative, or combine common elements:

1.  `[Firstname][Lastname]` (e.g., JohnDoe, JaneSmith)
2.  `[Firstname][Numbers]` (e.g., Mike123, Sarah87)
3.  `[Interest]Fan` (e.g., FootballFan, GamerGirl)
4.  `[Animal]Lover` (e.g., CatLover, DogMom)
5.  `[BirthYear][Name]` (e.g., Bob1985, Lisa02)
6.  `[Adjective][Noun]` (e.g., HappyDude, CrazyCatLady)
7.  `X_[Name]_X` (e.g., X_Jess_X, X_Gamer_X)
8.  `Official[Name]` (e.g., OfficialDave, OfficialAshley)
9.  `Its[Name]` (e.g., ItsMeChris, ItsLily)
10. `[Name]Rocks` (e.g., KevinRocks, MaryRocks)
